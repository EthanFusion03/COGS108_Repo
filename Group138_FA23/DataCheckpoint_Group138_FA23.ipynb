    "Income equality is a critical issue in society, impacting the quality of life and well-being of many individuals. Various factors, such as education level, occupation, gender, and marital status can contribute to these differences in income. For instance, in 2022, individuals with doctoral and professional degrees earned three times more per week than those with less than a high school diploma.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Occupation type also plays a pivotal role, with some roles offering higher salaries than others.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Gender has been shown to play a factor in pay. In 2022, a Pew Research study found that American women were found to earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by American men.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) It is essential to better understand what these factors are to impose policies to counter this inequality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research in this field has explored the relationship between various demographic characteristics and income levels. Christopher Tamborini, Changhwan Kim, and Arthur Sakamoto explored the association between education and income in one of their works, “Education and Lifetime Earnings in the United States”. They used data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 2004 matched to the Detailed Earnings Record (DER) constructed by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and utilized regression analysis to estimate the net effect of college education on long-term earnings. This revealed a positive correlation between education and lifetime earnings, as well as a gap, implying the differences in earnings based on educational attainment. The results also provided insight into gender differences in lifetime earnings, demonstrating that men consistently earned more than women across all educational levels.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Max Roser contributed to understanding income, job, and wealth inequality between men and women in “Economic Inequality by Gender”. Through the analysis of data presented by various sources, including the United Nation’s International Labor Organization (ILO), as well as through a review of relevant research on these inequalities, they found that men tend to earn more than women in all regions of the world. Their analysis also revealed the underrepresentation of women in senior positions within firms.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to build upon this prior work by investigating the impact of specific factors, such as education level and length, work class (private vs. self-employed), occupation, marital status, and gender on an individual’s income. Specifically, we aim to determine whether or not specific factors impact one’s likelihood of earning an annual income exceeding $50,000. To accomplish this, we plan on using one of the datasets available on UCI’s Machine Learning Repository and conducting an analysis of these factors and their effects on income. \n",
